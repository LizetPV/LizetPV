### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Yesenia! I am a frontend developer with a passion for creating attractive and functional user interfaces. I use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring designs to life and enhance the user experience. My main goal is to create websites that are intuitive and visually pleasing.
